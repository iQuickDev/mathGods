            <p id="desc" class="description">Algebra is one of the broad areas of mathematics, together with number
                theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols
                and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. It
                includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings,
                and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra; the more abstract parts are
                called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential
                for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and
                economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional
                mathematicians.
                Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand
                for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.</p>
